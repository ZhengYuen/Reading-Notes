# Reading-Notes
There are some of my reading notes(mostly in Chinese). Welcome to read/download them if you need.

I converted them from Evernote so they can be displayed directly in web browser, but it's better to download them and view them in a morden text editor such as Sublime Text 3. I'm also working on regular expression these days and palnning to conver these txt files into HTML files so you can read them easier.
